# Mathematical operator '+' for list
# Note: By using + operator for list bot argument should be list only if one is list and another is not list
# in that case will get TypeError
x = [10, 20, 30, 40]
y = [50]
z = x + y
print(z)

# #################
# x = [50, 60, 70, 80, 90]
# y = 100
# z = x + y
# print(z)

###### Another Operator is '*' Repetiation operator
# For this operator one argument should be list and another should be int only
y = 2
x = [10, 20, 30]
z = x * y
print(z)
